<p>The objective of the Post-Secondary Education Program is to improve the employability of First Nations students by providing them with access to education and skill development opportunities at the post-secondary level. This is expected to lead to greater participation of First Nations students in post-secondary studies, higher First Nation graduation rates from post-secondary programs, and to improve individual, family and community well-being for First Nations through higher employment rates for First Nation people. It is expected that students funded by this program will have post-secondary educational outcomes comparable to those of other Canadians with similar educational and socio-economic backgrounds.</p>
