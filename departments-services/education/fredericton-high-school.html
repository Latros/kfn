<p>For Kingsclear students, the First Nations Resource room at Fredericton High School is located in room D122. Students can access this room before and after school, during breaks and at lunch. The resource team consists of Resource Teacher Wendy Davis, Cultural Transition Coordinator Jenica Atwin, Literacy Lead John Dewar, Math Leads Kelly Batt and Mellissa Creighton, and Education Assistants Cindy Francis, Larry Tomah, Paula Paul and Alex Tomer.</p>

<p>Students are provided with tutoring, one-on-one instruction and other academic supports including access to any necessary school materials or supplies, computer and printer usage. Cultural events and activities are facilitated through D122 and are open to all First Nations students in the school. We are proud to report that we promote an academic and community centered atmosphere within D122 that students very positively respond to.</p>
