### About the Comprehensive Community Plan

Kingsclear First Nation has initiated the process to update our 2004 Community Plan. We will be spending the next few months establishing our community’s collective goals and aspirations for the next 15-20 years. What will our community look like and be in 2030? How can we get there? This exciting visioning exercise will allow us to align plans and policies to fully realize Our Kingclear.<!--end-excerpt-->

There will be many opportunities to help shape our new Community Plan, including:

- Community-wide survey
- Community open houses
- Youth activities
- Website updates

### Current Involvement Opportunity: Planning Working Group

We are currently seeking passionate, civic-minded volunteers to play a key role in the community planning process. We are looking for community members to sit on the volunteer Planning Working Group to provide further input and oversight to the project and ensure the planning process remains a community-driven process. This is an excellent volunteer opportunity for those who are passionate about the future of Kingsclear First Nation.

If interested, leave your contact information with Melissa at the Band Hall front desk, or email our Community Planning Consultant, Stephen Stone, at [sstone@dillon.ca](mailto:sstone@dillon.ca).

Meetings will be held on a monthly basis throughout the planning process, unless otherwise stated. First meeting is tentatively scheduled for May 21st, 2015.
